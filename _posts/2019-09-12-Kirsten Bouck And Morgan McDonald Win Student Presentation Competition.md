Kirsten Bouck and Morgan McDonald, 2 of our Citizen Science GIS
undergraduates in the NSF CNH coastal connections project, were co-awarded a $500 prize for 2nd place in the student presentation competition at this week's Central Florida GIS Workshop.


They shared updates on the sense of place mapping work we've been working on in the Indian River Lagoon. In the project we want to learn about the Lagoon from community members, organizations, and citizen scientists. Our big questions: Why are particular places in the Indian River Lagoon meaningful to people, and how can this sense of place inform restoration? Kirsten and Morgan gave an awesome and very well-attended presentation.
