San Jose State University's Mineta Transportation Institute is fostering young minds through a summer drone-flying program for high school students, igniting their passion for science and engineering. Nearly three dozen local teens, including Presentation High School junior Sangyani Sinha, are part of the initiative, diving into drone piloting and hands-on learning. Sinha, intrigued by robotics and environmental engineering, envisions using technology to tackle pressing environmental challenges. Similarly, Piedmont High School senior Francesco Menegoli, aspiring to study civil engineering, cherishes the sense of community among like-minded peers in the program. The three-week course not only teaches drone skills but also cultivates a shared passion for math, science, and engineering, offering a glimpse into future college endeavors for these enthusiastic students.
