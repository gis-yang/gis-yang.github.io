The SJSU GIS & Drone Society successfully concluded a comprehensive data collection session at Wilder Ranch State Park. Led by Jannike Allen and David Benterou from the Fire Ecology & Management Lab, along with UC Santa Cruz collaborators, temperature data was gathered. Geography student Xiangyu REN contributed by capturing post-fire drone imagery, aiding in burn severity assessment and fuel volume estimates. This interdisciplinary effort showcased the significance of prescribed fire, emphasizing its ecological benefits. The team's dedication highlights the potential for further insights, underscoring the society's commitment to interdisciplinary research merging biology and geography. Hashtags #prescribedfire #beneficialfire #biology #geography encapsulate this collaborative achievement.
