We are thrilled to announce the NSF Build and Broaden 2024 summer fieldwork application is now open! This unique program invites students to participate in a four-week coastal mapping fieldwork adventure spanning Bodega Bay, Tomales Bay, Oregon, and Moss Landing. This initiative, supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), offers an invaluable opportunity for selected students to engage directly with the environment and cutting-edge research.

Participants will receive a $2,000 stipend and work alongside GeoFly Lab faculty and lab members. The program includes two weeks of fieldwork focused on collecting data in intertidal areas, exploring seagrass habitats, and investigating diseases. This hands-on experience will be complemented by two weeks of data processing, utilizing drone remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for high-resolution data analysis. Scheduled during the July or August low tide series, this program promises an immersive research experience.
