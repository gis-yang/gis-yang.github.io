The San Jose State University (SJSU) Drone class, known as GEOG282/173, recently embarked on an enriching field trip to Moss Landing Marine Lab, offering students a hands-on experience in the dynamic environment of Elkhorn Slough. This outing was more than just a practical exercise; it was an immersive journey into the world of research fieldwork, highlighting the practical applications of drone technology in environmental studies.

At Elkhorn Slough, students had the unique opportunity to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world scenarios, engaging in aerial mapping and data collection using advanced drone technology. This experience not only enhanced their understanding of drone operations but also provided valuable insights into ecological research and conservation efforts.

The field trip to Moss Landing Marine Lab is a testament to SJSU's commitment to providing experiential learning opportunities that bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. It showcases the university's dedication to preparing students for the challenges and opportunities in the field of geographic information science and technology.
