In an enlightening seminar held at the Department of Meteorology and Climate Science at San Jose State University (SJSU), Professor Bo Yang showcased the cutting-edge research being conducted in the realms of drone and remote sensing technologies. This presentation, a part of the SJSU College of Science MetCS seminar series, was made possible thanks to Dr. Minghui Diao's invitation, providing an invaluable platform for interdisciplinary knowledge exchange.

Professor Yang, an assistant professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at SJSU, leads the Wildfire Remote Sensing team at the SJSU GeoFly Lab. His presentation delved into the innovative use of drones for mapping and analyzing various aspects of wildfires, highlighting the significant contributions of drone technology in understanding and managing these natural disasters.

The seminar focused on several key projects, demonstrating the diverse applications of drone technology in wildfire research. One such project involved thermal drone mapping to study wildfire behaviors. This cutting-edge research utilized high-resolution data from drones equipped with thermal cameras to capture and analyze fire dynamics in real-time, providing crucial insights into fire spread and behavior.

Another area of focus was the use of drones in assessing prescribed burn volume and biodiversity estimation. This involved detailed analysis of digital surface models (DSMs) and vegetation growth post-fire. By leveraging drone technology, the team was able to accurately measure and evaluate the impact of fires on vegetation, aiding in better understanding and management of fire-prone ecosystems.

Professor Yang's team also explored the application of drone mapping in assessing Home Ignition Zones (HIZ). This research is particularly relevant in urban planning and management, as it helps in identifying and mitigating potential fire risks in residential areas. By utilizing drones to map and assess these zones, the team is contributing to improved safety and preparedness strategies against wildfires.

The seminar concluded with a discussion on the ongoing research at the San Vicente Redwoods (SVR) regarding post-fire treatment estimations. This project underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and assessment of fire-affected areas to understand the long-term impacts of wildfires on forest ecosystems.

Professor Yang's presentation, rich in data and insights, underscored the vital role of drone technology in advancing our understanding of wildfires. It highlighted how innovative remote sensing techniques are revolutionizing the field of environmental research and management. The seminar was not only informative but also an inspiring testament to the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration in tackling some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.

This event at SJSU's Department of Meteorology and Climate Science marks a significant milestone in bridging the gap between technology and environmental science. The insights shared by Professor Bo Yang and his team are not only crucial for academic research but also have profound implications for practical applications in wildfire management and urban planning. The full presentation, available below, is a must-watch for anyone interested in the latest advancements in drone technology and its applications in environmental science.
