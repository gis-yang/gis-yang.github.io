The study investigates the influence of traffic restrictions implemented during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games on urban heat dynamics using satellite thermal remote sensing. By analyzing daily MODIS satellite data on surface temperature and developing statistical models, the research reveals substantial reductions in mean surface temperature by 1.5-2.4 °C and a decrease in heat extent by 820 km2 in Beijing during the period when traffic volume was halved due to road space rationing. These findings suggest a significant correlation between urban traffic and heat intensity, underscoring the importance of managing traffic and fossil fuel use for future urban heat mitigation strategies. The study highlights the potential for traffic-related policies to positively impact urban heat in densely populated areas like Beijing.
