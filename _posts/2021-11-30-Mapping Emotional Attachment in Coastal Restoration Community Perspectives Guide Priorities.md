The study explores emotional attachment within the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, to inform coastal restoration priorities. Through Geographic Information Systems, aggregate emotional attachment data from stakeholders is mapped. Kernel density estimation (KDE) measures are employed at a broader lagoon scale, while inverse distance weighted (IDW) measures are used at more localized scales. Analyzing these results against participants' reasons for high or low attachment reveals varying spatial patterns of emotional connection as a facet of sense of place. The mapped outcomes aid in identifying and visualizing emotional attachment across different geographic regions, providing insights for prioritizing restoration strategies. This approach connects human systems data with natural systems, offering a valuable tool for restoration teams to align strategies with community sentiments.
