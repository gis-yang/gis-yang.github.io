CalGIS 2023, hosted by California URISA and the California Geographic Information Association, invites professionals to Monterey County for a comprehensive conference focused on GIS solutions, education, and networking opportunities. The event offers various registration options for different membership levels, including students, young professionals, and industry experts. Limited sponsorship and exhibit opportunities are available.

One of the engaging sessions at CalGIS 2023 is the "UAV/Drone Remote Sensing for California Wildfire (Mini Workshop)" scheduled for Wednesday, March 15, from 3:30 pm to 5:00 pm. This workshop, facilitated by Dr. Bo Yang, an Assistant Professor and SAVi Associate Director at San Jose State University, will showcase the practical applications of UAV technology and GIS in wildfire research. The session will cover the utilization of UAVs for mapping, processing, and analyzing drone data, including ground data processing, fuel classification mapping using Anderson's system, and employing machine learning algorithms for fire behavior analysis.

Highlighting the advantages of UAV technology, the workshop emphasizes its high spatial resolution, temporal flexibility, and efficiency in repeat photogrammetry, which significantly surpasses other remote sensing methods in wildfire mapping and modeling. The presentation will delve into the capabilities of low-altitude mapping in achieving unparalleled high-resolution outputs with optical, thermal, and LiDAR sensors, allowing for fine-scale fuel classification and vegetation canopy density assessment.

Furthermore, the discussion will explore the use of thermal UAV systems in capturing real-time geo-referenced videos amid fire smoke, providing insights into fire behavior and dynamics. Dr. Yang will also underscore the convenience and cost-effectiveness of drone mapping for post-wildfire monitoring and changes assessment. Attendees will gain valuable insights into cutting-edge technology's role in wildfire research and its potential impact on mapping and monitoring fire-related changes.
