The SJSU GIS & Drone Society had an impactful day at Wilder Ranch State Park collaborating with California State Parks' fire team. Professor Kate Wilkin's biology team gathered crucial fuel moisture and burn data, complemented by geography student Henri Brillon's post-burn aerial imagery for precise fuel volume estimates. This interdisciplinary effort showcased the benefits of prescribed fire. Gratitude was extended to everyone involved in this endeavor, emphasizing the significance of interdisciplinary research in merging biology and geography. The event exemplified the society's commitment to leveraging technology for understanding and enhancing the ecological significance of controlled burns. Hashtags #prescribedfire #beneficialfire #biology #geography highlighted this remarkable collaboration.
