GeoFly Lab at San Jose State University has achieved a remarkable milestone, receiving the prestigious NSF B2 program award for a groundbreaking project in collaboration with UC Davis. This initiative focuses on utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the advanced mapping of seagrass ecosystems. The project, supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), showcases the innovative integration of technology in environmental research.

Seagrasses, vital components of marine ecosystems, play a crucial role in maintaining coastal health and biodiversity. However, they are among the most threatened ecosystems globally. Traditional methods of mapping and monitoring these underwater grasslands are often challenging and time-consuming. The GeoFly Lab's project aims to revolutionize this process by employing UAVs equipped with advanced sensors and GIS technology. This approach promises to offer more detailed, accurate, and efficient mapping of seagrass habitats.

The collaboration with UC Davis brings together experts in ecology, remote sensing, and GIS, setting a new standard for interdisciplinary research. The project will enable scientists to obtain high-resolution data on seagrass distribution, density, and health, essential for conservation and restoration efforts. This data is crucial for understanding the impacts of environmental changes and human activities on these sensitive habitats.

The NSF B2 program's support is a testament to the innovative nature and potential impact of this project. It underscores the growing importance of UAV technology in environmental science and conservation efforts. By providing a novel approach to seagrass mapping, GeoFly Lab and UC Davis are at the forefront of ecological research and sustainable management of marine resources.
