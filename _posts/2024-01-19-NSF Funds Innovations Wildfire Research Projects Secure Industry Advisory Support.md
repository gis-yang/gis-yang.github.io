Exciting news! Both of our Industry Advisory Board proposals to the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center have secured funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) IUCRC. ðŸŽ‰ "Post-Wildfire Fuels Management using a Multi-source Remote Sensing Approach," led by Melina Kompella, and "Enhancing Community Fire Resilience Decision-Making: Drone Inspection for Home Ignition Zone," led by Henri Brillon, stood out in a competitive pool of proposals. This achievement marks a significant milestone for our group, and congratulations are in order for everyone involved! ðŸŒŸ #NSFfunding #WildfireResearch #MilestoneAchievement
