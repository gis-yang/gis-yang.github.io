The article highlights the immersive GIS fieldwork undertaken by University of Central Florida (UCF) researchers during the summer. Led by Dr. Timothy L. Hawthorne, the team engaged in a variety of projects centered on Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Their activities ranged from surveying land use changes in Delray Beach to gathering data on community resilience in Apopka and understanding urban food systems in Orlando. These hands-on experiences offered invaluable insights into real-world GIS applications and equipped the researchers with practical skills. By collaborating with community partners, students, and local organizations, the UCF team demonstrated the significance of GIS in addressing societal challenges. The article emphasizes the importance of experiential learning and community engagement in fostering a deeper understanding of GIS principles while contributing meaningfully to society.
