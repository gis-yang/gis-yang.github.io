[Original post](https://www.citizensciencegis.org/blog/top-5-csgis-drone-shots)

The work we do at CitizenScienceGIS often leads us to beautiful destinations, and we would love for our followers to be able to virtually experience all that we do. This is why we have compiled a list of our top 5 drone shots, in no specific order. For the best viewing experience, it is recommended that you watch each flight in full screen at 1080p or 1440p resolution, if possible.

1. The Indian River Lagoon is an important part of Florida's coastal ecosystem, supporting a variety of plant and wildlife. In this video, some of this diversity is visible, as you see birds flying through, and it proceeds to pan across a large portion of the lagoon.

2. This  footage, shot by Dr. Drone himself, is a simple but beautiful upward  shot of Carrie Bow Island, which we visited in Belize over the summer of  2019. As it begins, you can see the fluid movements of small sharks in  the crystal clear water. It leads to a slow upward pan, showing the  entirety of the island.

3. This  shot, by our former undergraduate research student Michael, is truly  gorgeous. Taken during our eelgrass expedition along the west coast,  this scene depicts a beautiful rocky shore and crashing waves at a site  in Bodega Bay Marine Lab, California. If you look closely, you can see  packs of seals sun bathing on the rocks.

4. In drone photography, the chase is one of the harder, but more interesting shots to take. This footage portrays a different perspective of the boat ride from one of our Washington sites in the San Juan Islands. Off in the distance are some scenic hilly islands.

5. This is another piece of footage from one of our beautiful locations in Belize. This shot is a chase down of one of the boats that our team took out to collect Ground Control Points (GCP) to aid in geo-referencing imagery. This low floating shot shows the contrast in water color as well as a closeup shot of the island.
