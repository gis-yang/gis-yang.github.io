We co-lead with [Dr. Timothy Hawthorne](https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/person/timothy-hawthorne/) the UAV mapping of coastal seagrass sites along the Pacific (west) coast of North America through a $1.3 million collaborative NSF grant for the UCF portion, one of the earliest attempts to employ UAV mapping in coastal management and seagrass conservation. This interdisciplinary project aims to assess the interactions of three major stressors to coastal ecosystems (climate warming, altered biodiversity, and disease) on the local and regional health of seagrass integrate ecological, microbiological, computational, geospatial analysis, and UAV remote sensing.

I have been leading a drone mapping team travel along the Pacific coast and collected over 10,000 drone remote sensing images along the U.S. Pacific coast. The drone remote sensing and field sampling sites include (From north to south): (1) six sites around Prince of Wales Island, Alaska; (2) five sites on the Central Coast of British Columbia (by Hakai team); (3) five sites in the San Juan Islands; (4) three sites in Yaquina Bay, Oregon; (5) two sites in Coos Bay, Oregon; (6) six sites in Bodega Bay and Tomales Bay, northern California; and (7) six sites in San Diego and Mission Bay in southern California.

I maintain an [Open-access drone mapping course](https://gis-yang.github.io/DroneMapping/) designed to teach the use of drones for collecting remote sensing data for coastal mapping and seagrass conservation. This training course was created for research partners and the broader community to learn how to fly drones and perform data processing using Geographic Information Science (GIS) methods. The course covers topics such as drone flight, coastal mapping principles, safety guidelines, preflight planning, FAA Part 107 examination, drone image stitching software, geographic fieldwork principles, and GIS-based drone image analysis..
