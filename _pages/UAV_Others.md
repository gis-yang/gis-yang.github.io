    title: "Drone mapping the Florida Coastal"
    excerpt: "Field trials of the multispectral UAV mapping were conducted over the Indian River Lagoon along the central Atlantic coast of Florida with Ground Control Points (GCPs), allowing for comparison to geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery. Multi-spectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) was also obtained for the same region to map land cover. NDVI and object-oriented classification methods were employed to compare the mapping capabilities of UAVs and satellites."

    title: "Mapping Joe minters Afirican American Village"
    excerpt: "The application of advanced technology to document and preserve an art installation demonstrated through the mapping and digital documentation of artist Joe Minter work. Minter, a found-object artist in Birmingham, has constructed a collection entitled African Village in America around his home in Birmingham, Alabama, which narrates his life story and cultural movement. Previously, visitors were required to view the monumental environment in person, but the digital rendering will make it accessible to a wider audience"

    title: "Drone for Hydological BML Management"
    excerpt: "This study aims to show the benefits of using higher resolution images in Best Management Practices (BMPs) analysis. A drone was used to collect better surface and elevation data, provided more accurate information about the study area, better watershed outlines, a more comprehensive list of suitable BMP locations, and a more reliable cost-effectiveness estimate than using low-resolution data. The study also determined how effective the chosen BMPs would be under future climate changes and identified the best BMPs for reducing urban runoff. "

    title: "Drone Mapping the OH Serpent Mound"
    excerpt: "The Serpent Mound is an ancient and fascinating archaeological site located in Adams County, Ohio, USA. The mound is thought to have been built by the Adena culture (800 BCE â€“ 100 CE) or the Fort Ancient culture (1000-1750 CE), though its exact origins are still debated among researchers. Drone mapping has been used to capture a bird's-eye view of the Serpent Mound, which is believed to have served as a sacred space for various ceremonial and spiritual purposes, possibly linked to astronomical events such as the summer solstice, winter solstice, and equinoxes."
