    title: "Drone mapping the Florida Coastal"
    excerpt: "This paper aims to demonstrate quantitatively the improved resolution achieved by utilizing a multispectral UAV mapping technique for advanced mapping and assessment of coastal land cover. Field trials of the multispectral UAV mapping were conducted over the Indian River Lagoon along the central Atlantic coast of Florida. Ground Control Points (GCPs) were collected to generate a rigorously geo-referenced dataset of UAV imagery, allowing for comparison to geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery. Multi-spectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) was also obtained for the same region to map land cover. NDVI and object-oriented classification methods were employed to compare the mapping capabilities of UAVs and satellites."
