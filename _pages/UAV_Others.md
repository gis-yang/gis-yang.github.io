    title: "Drone mapping the Florida Coastal"
    excerpt: "This paper aims to demonstrate quantitatively the improved resolution achieved by utilizing a multispectral UAV mapping technique for advanced mapping and assessment of coastal land cover. Field trials of the multispectral UAV mapping were conducted over the Indian River Lagoon along the central Atlantic coast of Florida. Ground Control Points (GCPs) were collected to generate a rigorously geo-referenced dataset of UAV imagery, allowing for comparison to geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery. Multi-spectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) was also obtained for the same region to map land cover. NDVI and object-oriented classification methods were employed to compare the mapping capabilities of UAVs and satellites."

    title: "Mapping Joe minters Afirican American Village"
    excerpt: "The application of advanced technology to document and preserve an art installation will be demonstrated through the mapping and digital documentation of artist Joe Minter's work. Minter, a found-object artist in Birmingham, has constructed a collection entitled "African Village in America" around his home in Birmingham, Alabama, which narrates his life story and cultural movement. With the University of Alabama's expertise in geographic imaging, art curation, digital cataloguing, and art history, a digital rendering is being created to provide immediate access to the artist's site-specific presentation of found-object sculptures for scholars and the public. Previously, visitors were required to view the monumental environment in person, but the digital rendering will make it accessible to a wider audience. "

    title: "Drone for Hydological BML Management"
    excerpt: "SAVI's drone workshop covers several aspects, including assessing participants and providing training in drone operations, preparing, planning, and realizing flights, discussing airspace regulations, processing and analyzing imagery, and managing data. Trainees are assigned self-study tutorials to promote continued learning for drone mapping. The training program consists of five sections that are implemented in the field and a post-training self-study guide to prepare participants for the FAA Part 107 examination. (Free for SJSU students)"
