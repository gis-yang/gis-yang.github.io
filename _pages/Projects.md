    title: "Drone and remote sensing for California wildfire"
    excerpt: "Our research utilizes UAV/drone remote sensing with meteorology instruments to investigate wildfire and burn events. Drones provide a cost-effective and temporally flexible approach, especially in low-latitude mapping, for capturing and monitoring fire events. Moreover, once implemented, drone mapping systems offer a convenient and cost-effective solution for repeatedly mapping and monitoring post-burn effects resulting from wildfires."

    title: "Drone mapping the Florida Coastal"
    excerpt: "Field trials of the multispectral UAV mapping were conducted over the Indian River Lagoon along the central Atlantic coast of Florida with Ground Control Points (GCPs), allowing for comparison to geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery. Multi-spectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) was also obtained for the same region to map land cover. NDVI and object-oriented classification methods were employed to compare the mapping capabilities of UAVs and satellites."

    excerpt: "The application of advanced technology to document and preserve an art installation demonstrated through the mapping and digital documentation of artist Joe Minter work. Minter, a found-object artist in Birmingham, has constructed a collection entitled African Village in America around his home in Birmingham, Alabama, which narrates his life story and cultural movement. Previously, visitors were required to view the monumental environment in person, but the digital rendering will make it accessible to a wider audience"
