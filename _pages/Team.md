    title: "William Lee"
    excerpt: "**Undergraduate Research Assistant (NSF REU)** <br />I'm a recent Geography graduate interested in incorporating a variety of disciplines and increasing my domain knowledge in the natural sciences, social sciences, or formal sciences to conduct GIS analyses. I joined the Geofly Lab for the NSF REU program at my alma mater, and am currently working on understanding the spatial impacts of eelgrass wasting disease. In the future, I plan to take my knowledge and experiences toward working as a GIS Developer or GIS Manager in either the public sector or private sector in the near future."

    title: "Alexis Herb"
    excerpt: "**NSF START Research Intern** <br />I have 2 bachelor’s degrees, Integrative Biology and Marine Science; I almost have a minor in Forestry (one class/technicality shy).  I’ve also done some Environmental Engineering graduate school work.  While in graduate school, I bumbled into upper division math and realized I liked that better.  Currently, I work part time as a GIS tech for a fire department.  As an intern in the NSF START program, I'm hoping to further develop skills in using drones to collect various types of data, and in using coding/AI to interpret that data.  As a person who likes the out-of-doors (and air conditioning :-), I enjoy how mapping allows me to go back and forth between something cerebral at a desk, and outside for field work."

    title: "Melina Kompella"
    excerpt: "**NSF START Research Intern** <br />I am a Geographic Information Systems Technology student at Foothill College and an NSF research intern at SJSU. I have worked in wildland fire for the Forest Service, and I am now pivoting to research in mapping fire behavior and management tools. I am interested in the role humans can play in managing fire-impacted landscapes and building ecosystem resilience. GIS technology and aerial mapping are fantastic tools for learning about these ecosystems while mitigating human impact, and I'm excited to use them in my research."

    excerpt: "**NSF START Research Intern** <br />I am a natural explorer with a background in photography and post production editing. I exited the nonprofit world during the pandemic and have embarked on a knowledge journey in hopes of centering my passion for the visual world in my work. I am certified in film and post production editing, a licensed drone pilot, and a seasoned photographer. I am new to GIS, but enjoying the ride."
