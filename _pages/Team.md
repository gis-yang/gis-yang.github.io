    title: "Jessica Reimann"
    excerpt: "I'm a recent Geography graduate interested in incorporating a variety of disciplines and increasing my domain knowledge in the natural sciences, social sciences, or formal sciences to conduct GIS analyses. I joined the Geofly Lab for the NSF REU program at my alma mater, and am currently working on understanding the spatial impacts of eelgrass wasting disease. In the future, I plan to take my knowledge and experiences toward working as a GIS Developer or GIS Manager in either the public sector or private sector in the near future."
