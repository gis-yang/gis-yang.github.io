## [Geo-statistical algorithms & ST-Cokriging](https://github.com/gis-yang/Crime-prediction)

For my doctoral dissertation, I developed and implemented a novel geo-statistical method that used to assimilate multi-scale data sets with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial densities. The algorithm has been made available in Python and ArcGIS packages with a user-friendly interface. High-performance computing on supercomputer and parallel computing are utilized to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.

## [Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)](https://grass.osgeo.org/)
I am in the developer team of GRASS7 for satellite image segmentation module (i.segment). GRASS GIS, commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System), is a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization.
