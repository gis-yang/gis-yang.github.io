    excerpt: "We developed a novel geostatistical technique to assimilate multiscale datasets that have varying temporal sampling frequencies and spatial densities. Our algorithm is available in both Python and ArcGIS packages and has a user-friendly interface. We utilized high-performance computing on supercomputers and parallel computing to increase the efficiency of the algorithm."
