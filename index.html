    excerpt: "We develop a spatio-temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) method for assimilating multi-sensor remote sensing data that optimally determines parameters by accounting for spatio-temporal covariance. This method yields more reliable assimilation results than previous methods, effectively filling data gaps while providing quantitative uncertainty estimates."
