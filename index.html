intro:
  - excerpt: '**GeoFly Lab** is an academic mapping lab in cutting-edge drone technologies and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at San Jos√© State University (SJSU). We use multi-platform Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, or drones), GIS, remote sensing, machine learning, and AI to investigate urban and environmental sciences, including coastal mapping, wildfire modeling, urban data science. Our research are funded by National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, USDOT/MTI, and CalFire.'
