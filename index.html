intro:
  - excerpt: 'The **GeoFly** Lab at San Jos√© State University specializes in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, UAV and drone on applications of seagrass mapping, wildfire modeling, and urban data science such as urban heat, crime, and transportation studies. We are a team aiming to use cutting-edge technologies integrated with advanced machine learning and AI algorithms, to address pressing environmental challenges. Our research has been widely funded by NSF, NASA, USDOT, and Cal Fire'

    excerpt: "We develop a spatio-temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) method for assimilating multi-sensor remote sensing data that optimally determines parameters by accounting for spatio-temporal covariance. This method yields more reliable assimilation results than previous methods, effectively filling data gaps while providing quantitative uncertainty estimates."
