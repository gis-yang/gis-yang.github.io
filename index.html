intro:
  - excerpt: '**GeoFly Lab** is a world-leading research lab in cutting-edge drone technologies and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at San Jos√© State University (SJSU). These include multi-platorm Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, or drones), GIS, remote sensing, machine learning, and AI to investigate urban and environmental science, including coastal seagrass mapping, wildfire modeling, urban heat, urban crime, and urban transportation. Our research has been extensively funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, USDOT/MTI, and CalFire.'
